This can be achieved by including, excluding, or rearranging the order of transactions. According to the statistic provided by MEV-Explore ',(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"/docs/research/references"},"[22]")," below, the total worth of MEV that may be extracted from Ethereum prior to the merge and up until September 2022 is around $676 million.
