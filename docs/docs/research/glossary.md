List of terms recommended to understand the contents of this research grant.

## **A**

### API (Application Programming Interface)

Set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the characteristics or data of an operating system, application or other specific service.

* * *

## **B**

### Backend

Backend is the data access layer of a software, which is not directly accessible by users, it contains the logic of the application that handles said data. The Backend accesses the server, which is a specialized application that understands the way the browser requests information.

* * *

### Blacklist

A blacklist is a measure that a blockchain node can take to prevent it from blocking any transaction that has been authorized by a defined list of blocked accounts or any transaction that interacts with a defined list of contracts. Each node can define its own blacklist, which cannot be seen publicly.

* * *

### Block

Blocks are files where the data belonging to the blockchain is permanently recorded. They store some or all of the most recent transactions that have not yet entered any previous blocks. A block is a permanent store of records that once written cannot be altered or deleted.

* * *

### Block Explorer

A block explorer is a program or website accessible through a browser that allows a user to search and navigate through the blocks of a blockchain, their contents and their relevant details.

* * *

### Block Height

It is defined as the number of blocks in the chain between a given block and the first block in the block chain. For example a block height of 500 refers to block number 500 of that chain.

* * *

### Block Rewards	

Bitcoin block reward refers to the new bitcoins that are awarded by the blockchain network to eligible cryptocurrency miners for each block they mine successfully.

* * *

### Blockchain 

A growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked by cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (usually represented as a Merkle tree).

* * *

### Bytecode Canonical

It is used for communication between different data formats. A form of business application integration, it aims to reduce costs and standardize the agreed definitions of data associated with the integration of business systems.

* * *

## **C**

### Chain ID

A chain ID is a blockchain configuration that affects the formation of an address. The binary transaction link between the address and the chain ID makes it impossible to move transactions between different blockchain networks.

* * *

## **D**

### DApps

They are digital applications or programs run on a blockchain or P2P computer network instead of a single computer, these are outside the reach and control of a single authority.

* * *

### DevOps

A set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. Its goal is to shorten the life cycle of systems development and provide continuous delivery with high-quality software.

* * *

### Docker

A set of platform as a service products that uses virtualization at the operating system level to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single core operating system, therefore using fewer resources than virtual machines.

* * *

## **E**

## **F**

## **G**

### Genesis JSON

`genesis.json` is the file that defines the `Genesis block`, which is the starting block of the blockchain. This is like the "configuration" of your blockchain. For example, the chain configuration and the level of difficulty to extract blocks.

* * *

### GitHub

A platform that provides hosting for version control of software development, in addition, it allows to manage distributed version control and the functionality of source code management, as well as its own characteristics. It provides access control and various collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for each project.

* * *
## **H**

### Hash

Is the process of transforming a string into a fixed-length key or value. A data string will always produce the same hash, so it is used as a means of checking the content of the string against the expected content.

* * *

### Head Block

The `Head Block` is the last block written on the blockchain, stored in reversible blocks.

* * *

## **I**

### IAC (Infrastructure as Code)

Is the process of managing computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

* * *

### IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)

A tool by which multiple blockchains can communicate with each other. This can be used to send tokens from one chain to another, or to expand the capacity of a network by increasing the number of chains running in parallel.

* * *

### Immutable

Term used to refer to something that cannot be changed.

* * *

### IPFS 

It is a distributed storage mechanism for putting files online for decentralized storage.

* * *

### Issue

`Issues` are a great way to track tasks, improvements and bugs for your projects through the GitHub platform.

* * *

## **J**

## **K**

### Kubernetes

`Kubernetes` is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

* * *

## **L**

### Latency

Period of time that elapses between the communication of a packet through the network.

* * *

### Launch

The term used to signify the beginning of a blockchain.

* * *

## **M**

### Merkle Tree

A `Merkle Tree` is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures.

* * *

### Multi-Sig

`Multisig` is a short term for multiple signatures.Itâ€™s used to describe the case in which one requires more than one account's permission to execute a transaction. 

* * *

## **N**

### Nodes

`node` is the fundamental basis of blockchain technology, they make up the infrastructure of a blockchain. All nodes in a blockchain are connected to each other and constantly exchange the latest data in the blockchain so that all nodes are kept up to date.

* * *

## **O**

### Oracle

An oracle is a system that makes off-chain data available on-chain. An example of this would be an oracle that takes the score of a basketball game and puts it on-chain for smart contracts to consume and base decisions on.

* * *

## **P**

### Private Key

A `private key` is a secret key used to sign transactions. In blockchain networks, a private key's authority is determined by it's mapping to a public key on the network.

* * *

### Proof of Work

`Proof of Work` is a consensus mechanism used by many blockchains, most notably by Bitcoin. The miner of the next block is the first to solve a hashing problem. The difficulty of this problem increases as more hashing power attempts to solve this problem at the same time. The ever-increasing amount of work that has gone into a blockchain over time is what protects the chain's history.

* * *

### Public Key

A publicly available key that can be authorized to permissions of an account and can be used to identify the origin transaction. A `public key` can be inferred from a signature.

* * *

### Pull Request

`Pull requests` let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. 

Once a `pull request` is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up `commits` before your changes are merged into the base branch.

* * *

## **Q**

## **R**

## **S**

### Smart Contract

A `smart contract` is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.

* * *


### Stake 

Tokens deposited in a smart contract is referred to as your stake.

* * *

## **T**

### TestNet 

A test `network` or `testnet` is an instantiation of the EOSIO platform that is intended for testing purposes. Generally, the native token has no value and is given away to developers so they can test.

* * *

### Tokens

The unit of measurement of a cryptocurrency.

* * *

### TPS

Transactions Per Second. A metric by which the performance of a blockchain is measured.

* * *

### Transactions

It is a combination of one or more actions. Usually the result of executing a `smart contract`.

* * *

## **U**

## **V**

## **W**

### Wallet

`Wallets` are clients that store keys that may or may not be associated with the permissions of one or more accounts. Ideally a wallet has a locked (encrypted) and unlocked (decrypted) state that is protected by a high entropy password.

* * *

### Whitelist

A whitelist is a subjective measure that a blockchain node can implement to allow transactions to be placed in a block only if they are listed in your account or contract whitelist. Each node can specify its own whitelist, which cannot be seen publicly.
