List of terms recommended to understand the contents of this research grant.

## **A**

### Account

An object that has an address, a balance, a nonce, and possibly some storage and code as well. An account may be either a contract account or an externally owned account (EOA).

* * *

### Address

This is typically an EOA or contract that can receive (destination address) or send (source address) blockchain transactions. Furthermore, it is the rightmost 160 bits of an ECDSA public key's Keccak hash.

* * *

### API (Application Programming Interface)

Set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the characteristics or data of an operating system, application or other specific service.

* * *

## **B**

### Backend

Backend is the data access layer of a software, which is not directly accessible by users, it contains the logic of the application that handles said data. The Backend accesses the server, which is a specialized application that understands the way the browser requests information.

* * *

### Base Fee

The reserve price for each block is known as the "base fee." It is the minimum gas fee a user must pay for a transaction to be included in the subsequent block.

* * *

### Blacklist

A blacklist is a measure that a blockchain node can take to prevent it from blocking any transaction that has been authorized by a defined list of blocked accounts or any transaction that interacts with a defined list of contracts. Each node can define its own blacklist, which cannot be seen publicly.

* * *

### Block

Blocks are files where the data belonging to the blockchain is permanently recorded. They store some or all of the most recent transactions that have not yet entered any previous blocks. A block is a permanent store of records that once written cannot be altered or deleted.

* * *

### Block Explorer

A block explorer is a program or website accessible through a browser that allows a user to search and navigate through the blocks of a blockchain, their contents and their relevant details.

* * *

### Block Height

It is defined as the number of blocks in the chain between a given block and the first block in the block chain. For example a block height of 500 refers to block number 500 of that chain.

* * *

### Docker

A set of platform as a service products that uses virtualization at the operating system level to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single core operating system, therefore using fewer resources than virtual machines.

### Private Key  (aka Secret Key)

A `private key` is a secret key used to sign transactions. In blockchain networks, a private key's authority is determined by it's mapping to a public key on the network.

* * *

### Proof of Work

`Proof of Work` is a consensus mechanism used by many blockchains, most notably by Bitcoin. The miner of the next block is the first to solve a hashing problem. The difficulty of this problem increases as more hashing power attempts to solve this problem at the same time. The ever-increasing amount of work that has gone into a blockchain over time is what protects the chain's history.
