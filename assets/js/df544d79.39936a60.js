An eclipse attack is an attack that allows an adversary to isolate a target node within the P2P network by gaining complete control of a node\'s access to information or control over everything that the node sees. This attack is discussed in the context of the Ethereum P2P Network. The authors developed an eclipse-attack detection model called ETH-EDS that mainly targets the Ethereum platform. This model used the random forest classification technique to examine both normal and attack data packets in the network. The collected data packets included details like the size of the tags packets, the frequency with which they were accessed, and the access time. The findings of the experiments show that malicious network nodes could be identified with a high degree of precision.'))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
