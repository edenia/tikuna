Our project focuses on the lowest level layer in the blockchain, particularly the P2P network that allows the nodes to communicate with each other and share information. This layer is a vital component of any blockchain, including Ethereum, due to the decentralized nature of its architecture. However, the P2P network layer may be vulnerable to several attacks, such as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), eclipse attacks, or Sybil attacks. Consequently, this layer is still prone to many threats inherited from P2P networks, and there is a need to analyze and understand them by collecting data and extracting insights from the network behavior to reduce those risks. We introduce Tikuna, an open-source tool for monitoring and detecting potential attacks on the Ethereum blockchain network at an early stage. Tikuna employs an unsupervised Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for anomaly detection to find attacks on the P2P layer.
